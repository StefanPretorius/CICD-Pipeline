Root calculator with Unit Tests
===
By Mark Narain Enzinger

## Overview

This root claculator uses the [Shifting nth root algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_nth_root_algorithm) to calculate the square root of a number by calculating each of its decimal places one after the other. 

The program can currently calculate a maximum of 8 digits of the square root of a number. 

Unit tests for this program are included as a second project in the same solution. 

I have also made the same program in Python and TypeScript. 

## Requirements

- Visual Studio
